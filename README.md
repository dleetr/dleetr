A friendly reminder from the past to do something with this page; even on first transcription it seems overbloated.

- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm ***@dleetr***. This document is an eternal work-in-progress as we all are.
- üì´ [Contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/__dleetr__)
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...
  - UX Architecture
    - [I recently found this really great blog/note collection](https://alexanderobenauer.com/) that captures a lot of what I've had
    floating around in my head for years in many of its posts.
  - Managing Knowledge:
    - Note Software:
      - [A fairly recent note-taking software: Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
        - I have a small idea for an extension that might let users share notebooks via p2p requests. I must understand more first.
      - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
      - I'm currently researching the p2p note share idea as a kind of "engine" that integrates into note taking software. I enjoy using Obsidian but there's no reason to lock into its ecosystem.
  - Building a Web extension to streamline browsing
    - I'm working (slowly) on this; I don't have the repo published yet. 
    - Rambling Thoughts:
      - *Motivations*:
        - I process a lot every day (I currently have about 40 tabs open and I know more or less where everything is) 
        and end up with a lot of interconnected data. I hate the idea of losing this data, but I often end up having to purge much of it.
        Even if I don't ever use it I would rest much easier if I could just capture this data rapidly without breaking the flow of actually learning.
        - There's so many ways to manage all this data but they require you to be so involved to make any use of it. Needless to say
        it's really inefficient to rediscover things but at the same time I have such a need to catalogue this data for my own use.
        - Beyond my own use there's a definite web of knowledge already built by others who have gone through this web. How many times has someone visited the
        exact series of links you've iterated through? How many times have they made a misstep? Imagine all the collective time we've spent as modern humans
        tackling the same problem of finding the exact same kind of knowledge. I shudder to think about even the appropriate metric that must be measured in.
        - How can we gather our own knowledge in such a way that's as automatic as possible? How do we make the transition from noise to data to knowledge?
      - *A transformative browsing experience*:
        - I came up with the name *TabMaster* because I had always thought of my tabs as the most atomic form of data you have in a browser, and they are to a degree.
        But what I want to actually do is transform the entire experience of browsing the web. As I said previously, there's *so* many ways of achieving it. We're overwhelmed
        with this choice of data. We need one way to store it.
        - *A single-channel experience*. The idea of a bookmark, a reading list, a group of tabs, it all has to go. We must wipe the slate clean as we often do upon success
        in our knowledge quest. If we continue with this myriad of tools we will have just that: a myriad of knowledge - chaos.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
  - Vue
  - Snowpack
  - Ways to become more productive that are actually meaningful and not just performed outright.
  - What I want to do with this page.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...
  - Resources to improve as an early in career developer. Traversing the collective mountain of human knowledge and trying to catch up sometimes feels like an insurmountable task.
