- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm ***@dleetr***. This document is an eternal work-in-progress as we all are.
- üì´ [Contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/__dleetr__)
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...
	- The future of web development, I love learning about bleeding-edge tech!
  - UX Architecture
    - [I recently found this really great blog/note collection](https://alexanderobenauer.com/) that captures a lot of what I've had
    floating around in my head for years in many of its posts.
  - Managing Knowledge:
    - Note Software:
      - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
        - I have a small idea for an extension that might let users share notebooks via p2p requests. I must understand more first.
      - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
      - [Dendron] my new favorite! Trying to become familiar with the tool and codebase
      - I'm currently researching the p2p note share idea as a kind of "engine" that integrates into note taking software. I enjoy using Obsidian but there's no reason to lock into its ecosystem.
  - Building a Web extension to streamline browsing
	  - *Motivations*:
        - I have a ton of tabs open. Sometimes I use a lot of them, sometimes I hardly use any of them.
        - Chrome's journey feature isn't even worthy of being called mediocre, espescially when it's hidden away in a subactivity (it's a 2nd tab to your history)
        - Also, I hate making and organizing bookmarks.
			- Which folder should it go in?
			- Which subfolder!?
			- Should it go in two?!?!?!
			- My current preferred approach is to just shove everything in a text file, which I will inevitably forget about.
		- Managing knowledge takes too much effort for the speed I want to discover knowledge.
		- Beyond my own use there's a definite web of knowledge already built by others who have gone through this web. 
			- How many times has someone visited the exact series of links you've iterated through? How many times have they made a misstep? Imagine all the collective time we've spent as modern humans tackling the same problem of finding the exact same kind of knowledge. I shudder to think about even the ***appropriate metric*** that must be measured in.
	- How can we gather our own knowledge in such a way that's as automatic as possible? How do we make the transition from noise to data to knowledge?
	  - *A transformative browsing experience*:
		- I came up with the name *TabMaster* because I had always thought of my tabs as the most atomic form of data you have in a browser, but they're not truly atomic. Our atom must be more than just a tab, a tab merely contains the atoms of the web.
		- We must ***transform*** the entire experience of browsing the web. As I said previously, there's *so* many ways of achieving it. We're overwhelmed
		with this choice of data. We need one way to store it: an immutable atom.
		- *A single-channel experience*.
			-  The idea of a bookmark, a reading list, a group of tabs, it all has to go. We must embrace the atom.
			-  If we continue with this myriad of tools we will have just that: a myriad of knowledge - chaos.
- üå± I'm currently learning ...
	- Dendron (tool + codebase)
	- Rust
	- Webpack
	- Snowpack
	- Wasm
- ‚ú®I want to learn ...
	- Webgl
	- ThreeJS
	- The future of web development
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...
  - Resources to improve as a software developer. Traversing the collective mountain of human knowledge and trying to catch up sometimes feels like an insurmountable task.
  - Projects involving *rust, wasm, webgl*
  - Contributing to PKMs
  - Toolchain POCs
